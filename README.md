# UCX/OS - Microcontroller Executive / OS

UCX/OS is an experimental preemptive kernel for microcontrollers, aimed to be easily ported. The kernel implements a lightweight multitasking environment (based on fibers/coroutines and standard setjmp() and longjmp() library calls), using a minimum amount of resources.
